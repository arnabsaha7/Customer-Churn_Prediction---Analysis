# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn in a business context. The project utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on various features.

## Features

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnabsaha7/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

   Follow the instructions and explore the notebook to understand the EDA, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Project Structure

- `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.
- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset (if not included in the repository).
- `images/`: Directory to store images or plots generated during the analysis.

## Results

The trained model achieved excellent accuracy; however, further investigation is needed to ensure generalization and address potential overfitting.
